    "    - The **`logging` module** in Python is used for tracking and recording events that happen during the execution of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "        **Purpose:**\n",
    "        1. Provides a **flexible framework** for logging messages from your program.\n",
    "        2. Helps in **debugging**, **monitoring**, and tracking **errors** or events.\n",
    "        3. Allows the logging of messages to various outputs, like the **console**, **files**, or **remote servers**.\n",
    "        4. Supports different **log levels** (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).\n",
    "        5. Ensures that logs can be **customized** and **formatted** to suit specific needs."

    "        **Key Uses in File Handling:**\n",
    "        1. **File and Directory Management**:\n",
    "            - Create, remove, or change directories (e.g., `os.mkdir()`, `os.rmdir()`, `os.chdir()`).\n",
    "        2. **Path Operations**:\n",
    "            - Work with file paths, such as checking if a file exists or getting its absolute path (e.g., `os.path.exists()`, `os.path.abspath()`).\n",
    "        3. **File Permissions**:\n",
    "            - Change file permissions (e.g., `os.chmod()`).\n",
    "        4. **Environment and Process Management**:\n",
    "            - Work with environment variables or execute system commands (e.g., `os.environ`, `os.system()`).\n",

    "        1. **Garbage Collection Overhead**: The automatic garbage collection can cause performance overhead, especially in memory-intensive programs.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        2. **Circular References**: Objects that reference each other in a cycle might not be cleaned up immediately, leading to memory leaks if not handled properly.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        3. **Reference Counting Limitations**: Python’s reference counting might not immediately release memory, leading to higher memory usage in some cases.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        4. **Fragmentation**: Python’s memory management can cause fragmentation in long-running applications, where memory is not used optimally.\n",

    "        **Key Benefits:**\n",
    "        1. **Improves Performance**: Especially for **I/O-bound** tasks, like reading from a file or making network requests, as threads can work while others wait.\n",
