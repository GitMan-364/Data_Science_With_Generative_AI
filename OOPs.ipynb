    "    - **Object-Oriented Programming** (OOP) is a programming approach that organizes code using objects rather than actions. It models real-world entities as objects that contain both data (attributes) and behaviors (methods). OOP promotes reusable and modular code by grouping related logic into classes and objects.\n",

    "    - **Dunder methods** (also known as **magic methods**) are special methods in Python that have double underscores at the beginning and end of their names (hence \"dunder\", short for **\"double underscore\"**). These methods allow us to define or customize the behavior of objects for built-in operations like printing, adding, comparing, etc.\n",

    "    - **Inheritance** is an OOP concept where one class (called the *child* or *subclass*) inherits the properties and behaviors (methods   and attributes) of another class (called the *parent* or *superclass*). This allows code reuse and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes.\n",

Method overriding allows the subclass to customize or extend the functionality of the inherited method, thus offering a more specialized behavior.\n",

    "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python ?\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Multiple Inheritance** in Python is a feature where a class can inherit attributes and methods from **more than one parent class**.\n",
    "\n",
    "        This allows a child class to have the combined functionality of multiple base classes, which can be useful in scenarios where behaviors from different classes need to be reused.\n",
    "\n",
    "        **Example:-**\n",
    "\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        class Father:\n",
    "            def skills(self):\n",
    "                print(\"Gardening, Driving\")\n",
    "\n",
    "        class Mother:\n",
    "            def skills(self):\n",
    "                print(\"Cooking, Painting\")\n",
    "\n",
    "        class Child(Father, Mother):\n",
    "            def skills(self):\n",

    "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance ?\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Polymorphism allows methods to have the same name but behave differently based on the object that calls them. In Python, this is typically achieved through method overriding in subclasses. The subclass method is called instead of the superclass method, allowing different behaviors.\n",

    "        **Example:-**\n",
